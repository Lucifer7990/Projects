# Projects
Create a well-structured project folder for frontend development, including HTML, CSS, JS, Design, UX, and UI sections. HTML contains web pages, CSS stores styles, JS manages scripts, Design holds design files, UX houses user experience assets, and UI stores graphical elements. Keep it organized for efficient development and collaboration.
